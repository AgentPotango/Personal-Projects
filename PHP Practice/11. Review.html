<p>Awesome work! We’ve covered a lot of material in this lesson, so let’s review: </p>

<ul>
<li>Strings are collections of text that the computer treats as a single piece of data.</li>
<li>A string can be any length and contain any letters, numbers, symbols, or spaces surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
<li>In order to include certain characters inside strings we have to use escape sequences.</li>
<li>An operator is a character that performs a task in our code.</li>
<li>We can use the concatenation operator (.) to combine two strings into one.</li>
<li>Variables are a fundamental programming concept which allow us to easily reuse data in our code.</li>
<li>We declare a variable using the dollar sign ($) followed by the variable name and then use the assignment operator (=) to give it a value.</li>
<li>PHP has variable parsing which allows us to include variables directly in our strings.</li>
<li>Once a variable has been assigned, we can change its value. This is called reassignment.</li>
<li>We can create an alias for a variable, instead of just a copy, using the reference assignment operator (=&).</li>
<li>Operations to the right of the assignment operator will be evaluated before assignment takes place.</li>
<li>The concatenating assignment operator (.=) is a shorthand notation for reassigning a string variable to its current value appended with another string value. </li>
</ul>
