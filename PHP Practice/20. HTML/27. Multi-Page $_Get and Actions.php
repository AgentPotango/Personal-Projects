<!-- Forms default to displaying the current page
	Giving it an action can result in redirecting the user from this page to another
	Works for both $_POST and $_GET methods.

<!--
Sometimes there is no need to present a user with the same form over and over again. 
It might make sense to move them to a new page or thank them for their submission.

This is where the action form attribute comes into play. 
Since we have not specified an action yet, HTML defaults to submitting the form data back to the 
same script that defined the form.

If you would like to have the user navigate to a new URL and handle the form input there, 
you can specify the URL in the formâ€™s action attribute. 
Since the action attribute specifies a relative URL, 
you can also enter the name of a PHP file in the same directory as the current one.

For example, given this directory:

index.php
receive_form.php
To handle a form using receive_form.php from index.php, you would use the following:


<form method="get" action="receive_form.php">
This works for both GET and POST methods.
</form>
-->

<form method="get" action="27.1 greet_user.php">
First Name:
<input type="text" name="first">
<br>
Last Name:
<input type="text" name="last">
<br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

<!-- This variable is the current page name and resets it by refreshing.--> 
<a href="27. Multi-Page $_Get and Actions.php">Reset</a>
