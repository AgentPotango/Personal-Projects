INTRO TO BUILT-IN PHP FUNCTIONS
Review
In this lesson, you learned that built-in functions are functions provided by PHP. You learned about several specific built-in functions, how to understand a function’s description in the documentation, and how to discover new built-in functions.

We’ve only started to scratch the surface of all of the functions built into the PHP language. As you continue to learn PHP, you’ll come across many useful built-in functions. As you write your own code, if a task you’re performing feels tedious but common, check to see if there’s a built-in function to do it for you!

One final note: Throughout this lesson, you may have noticed that PHP’s built-in functions often don’t follow the function naming conventions we outlined. PHP’s built-in functions aren’t named following a single convention—some are snake-cased while others have unseparated words. It’s quirks like this that can make PHP a bit frustrating to learn. Be patient with yourself as you get comfortable with the built-in functions most useful to you, and don’t hesitate to look things up.
