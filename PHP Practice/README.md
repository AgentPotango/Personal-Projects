# PHP Files
Some of these files contain a lot more code than just one individual function. 
One example is in the If Statements folder which looks pretty barren, however, upon opening the document, you can see the various other functions and lessons in there

Reviews are essential copy pasted reviews from code academy - as are some programs like sortinghat in If Statements folder.
The majority of the code is my own - I just chose to save my code on my own desktop upon completing it on code academy to keep a memoir of my past work.
