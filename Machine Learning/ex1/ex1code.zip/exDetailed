Exercise 1: Looked at Demos

Exercise 2: factorial(15) = 1.3077e+12

Exercise 3: A = [16 3 2 13; 5 10 11 8; 9 6 7 12; 4 15 14 1]
	      = 16 3  2  13
		5  10 11 8
		9  6  7  12
		4  15 14 1
	    
	    B = eye(4) = 1 0 0 0 
			 0 1 0 0 
			 0 0 1 0
			 0 0 0 1

Exercise 4: sum(A(:,3)) = 34

Exercise 5: A(:,[1,3]) = 16 2
			 5  11
			 9  7
			 4  14

Or with more colons ... A(:,1:2:3) aka all rows and  columns starting from 1 to 3 in steps of 2.

Exercise 6: sum(A) =  34 34 34 34 (Sum of the columns of A)
	    
	    sum(A') = 34 34 34 34 (Sum of the transposed columns of A. aka A's rows.)

Exercise 7: A*B =  16 3  2  13
		   5  10 11 8
		   9  6  7  12
		   4  15 14 1
	   
	    A.*B = 16 0  0 0
		   0  10 0 0
		   0  0  7 0
                   0  0  0 1


Exercise 8: sum(A>10) = 1 1 2 2
			1 in the first column
			1 in the second column
			2 in the third column
			2 in the fourth column

Exercise 9: x = 1:100;
	    y = log(x);
	    plot(x,y);
	    xlabel('x');
	    ylabel('log(x)');
	    

Exercise 10: for i=1:4
		for j=1:4
		  B(i,j)=1/A(i,j);
		end;
	     end; 
	     
	     Or you can simply do B = 1./A
	     
	     sum(B) = 0.6236 0.6667 0.8052 1.2853
	     
	     Single Line Operation: C=sum(1./A)
