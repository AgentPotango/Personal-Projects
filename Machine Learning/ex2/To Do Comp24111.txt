part2: more features, confusion matrix : accuracy, sensitivity: leave-one out cross validation
	other forms of feature extraction.


Accuracy : This is the simplest scoring measure. It calculates the proportion of correctly classified instances.

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP+TN+FP+FN)

Sensitivity (also called Recall or True Positive Rate): Sensitivity is the proportion of actual positives which are correctly identified as positives by the classifier.

Sensitivity = TP / (TP +FN)

Specificity  (also called  True Negative Rate) : Specificity relates to the classifier’s ability to identify negative results. Consider the example of medical test used to identify a certain disease. The specificity of the test is the proportion of patients that do not to have the disease and will successfully test negative for it. In other words:

Specificity: TN / (TN+FP)

Precision: This is a measure of retrieved instances that are relevant. In other words:

Precision: TP/(TP+FP)




part3: maybe average?
