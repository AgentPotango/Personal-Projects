Trying 130.88.195.11...
Connected to soba.cs.man.ac.uk. 
Escape character is ’ˆ]’.

Notes:
telnet used to login to remote machine 
in this case it takes the input from the keyboard, sends it over the network 
to a remote server, and sends us back whatever the server says
IP address for the domain name is connected to. 
Hostname is soba.cs.man.ac.uk
portnumber is 80 usually used for webservers

Relationship explained:
soba.cs.man.ac.uk is the address people in to go to a website.
The 'real' address is the ip address which tells the server which stores the
domain server which website files to access.
