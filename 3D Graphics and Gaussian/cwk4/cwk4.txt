1. The value 0 - 256 in a matrix to determine the colour of the pixels

2. 
r is the number of rows in the image (i.e. the size of the first dimension). = 300
c is the number of columns in the image (i.e. the size of the second dimension). = 400
d can be referred to as the "depth" or "planes" of the image (i.e. the size of the third dimension) = 3

3. Creates a zero matrix of the dimensions given (300, 399);
diff1 shows a black and white image of the image input
it also has the original image's pixel value of a column
minus the pixel value of the same image of the previous column
